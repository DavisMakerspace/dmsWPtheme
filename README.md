#### Once set up with a local install of WP, you can clone the dmsWPtheme theme in your theme directory:
> wp-content/themes/dmsWPtheme

#### You can email me and ask me for the database.

#### Or, you can add the pages and plugins manually and follow the following directions:

* Go to the WordPress dashboard, and click on Appearance > Themes. Youâ€™ll see the dmsWPtheme theme listed with all the default themes. Select dmsWPtheme and activate it.

* In the WordPress dashboard create an about page, a contact page, and a home page.

* Go to Appearance > Customize > Homepage Settings, and under 'Your homepage displays':
  * select 'A static page'
  * Under 'Homepage' select 'Home'

* Navigate to the page menu, so that you edit the 'Home' page.
  * From the right-hand dropdown, select the "Front" template.
  * Publish the changes
