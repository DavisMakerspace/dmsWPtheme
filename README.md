# dmsWPtheme, Davis Makerspace's Custom Wordpress Theme

#### For those not familiar with building WP themes, here is a basic tutorial:
https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/

## This theme contains (Bootstrap 4)[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/]. 

#### Once set up with a local install of WP, you can clone the dmsWPtheme theme in your theme directory:
> wp-content/themes/dmsWPtheme

#### You can email me and ask me for the database.

#### Or, you can add the pages and plugins manually and follow the following directions:

* Go to the WordPress dashboard, and click on Appearance > Themes. Youâ€™ll see the dmsWPtheme theme listed with all the default themes. Select dmsWPtheme and activate it.

* In the WordPress dashboard create an 'About' page, a 'Contact' page, and a 'Home' page.

* Go to Appearance > Customize > Homepage Settings, and under 'Your homepage displays':
  * select 'A static page'
  * Under 'Homepage' select 'Home'

* Navigate to the page menu, so that you edit the 'Home' page.
  * From the right-hand dropdown, select the "Front" template.
  * Publish the changes

* Go to Appearance > Menus
  * Click 'create a new menu', naming it 'top'
  * Under 'Menu Settings' at the bottom of the page, select 'Primary'
  * Select the pages you'd like to appear in the menu (all probably) and click 'Add to menu'.


#### When you navigate back to the home page, you should see the code written in the 'page-front.php' file.
